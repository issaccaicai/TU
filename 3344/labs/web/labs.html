                <h3>Lab 1: Home Page</h3>
                <ul style="color:rgb(83, 60, 91)">
                    <li> My experience with HTML,CSS,Javascript/jquery is pretty limited. This is probably 
                        the first time that I hear those client side frameworks.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I am able to optimize the layout, make images at different places.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I familiarized myself  with HTML and CSS. I learned how to deal with background 
                        color and font size for the web pages.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3><a href="02_advLayout/index.html">Lab 2: Advanced Layout</a></h3>
                <ul style="color:rgb(83, 60, 91)">
                    <li>I am kind of new to html coding. Therefore, I have plenty of things need to learn. There 
                        are a lot of difficult parts in this lab. </li>
                    <li>The jQuery and media query are hard for me. I  need to perform a web page both properly 
                        on desktop or on mobile devices. The easy part is form page. </li>
                    <li> So, I learned a lot of things from this lab. I could deal with so many html 
                        coding.</li>

                </ul>

                    <li> This lab is relatively easier than first two labs. I am getting 
                        familiar with html coding. </li>

                    <li>There are plenty of naming error(carObj)for this lab, therefore
                        I have to spend a lot of time to check the script.</li>

                <h3><a href="04_js_adv/index.html">Lab 4: Advanced JavaScript</a></h3>
                <ul style="color:rgb(83, 60, 91)">


                    <li> This lab assignment was easier than before. I learned how to using 
                        sorting and tables.</li>
                    <li> The hardest part is sorting part. I had to sort everything in correct 
                        order. I had to spend time to think of that.</li>
                    <li>The easier part was to arrange the tables, titles, and word formatting,

                        the image to the window. Sometimes, the image is larger or smaller. So, I had 
                        to spend time to look over my code from the beginning.</li>
                    <li>I learned how to use javascript framework for this lab to perform a picture gallery.</li>
